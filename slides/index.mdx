<Title>Why Suspense Will Be a Game Changer</Title>

---

# What is Suspense

Suspense is an upcoming React Feature that lets you handle async data flows much easier.

---

# Throw Promises

By throwing a promise within a components render, you "suspend" it until the Promise resolves. React will then try again to render the component.

---

<JSX>
{`function Example ({ id }) {
  const data = cache.read(id);
  // ^ this will throw a promise if data is not
  //   already in the cache
  return <p>{data}</p>;
}`}
</JSX>

---

# Catch Promises

To handle loading states, you can catch these thrown Promises anywhere in your component tree and render fallbacks as needed.

---

<JSX>
{`function App () {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Example</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
        <Some>
          <DeepNested>
            <ComponentTree>
              <AsyncComponent />
            </ComponentTree>
          </DeepNested>
        </Some>
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}`}
</JSX>

# Change Of Concern

Loading states are no longer a component but an app concern ðŸŽ‰
